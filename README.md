# Assignment 1

This is a dynamic product list assignment created with React.

## Files
I organized the file structure under the components folder as requested:
- **Card.jsx**: The box design around the products.
- **Product.jsx**: The component showing product information.
- **ProductList.jsx**: The place where I list the products.
- **App.jsx**: Main page. Button and input controls are handled here.

## Challenges
In general, I understood the logic. I just got stuck a bit on where exactly to put the `children` prop while making the Card component. Also, I wrote the import paths wrong at first when creating folders, but I fixed them later.
